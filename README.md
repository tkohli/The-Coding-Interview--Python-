# The Coding Interview (Python)
This is new repository in which we will first make a map and then follow it in order to complete all required topic in Programming interviews.
## Getting Started
We will start by first defining the scope of this repo.<br>
We will cover Data structure, Algorithms and Programming Concepts.
| Data structure      | Algorithms | Programming Concepts     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| Array and lists     |  Quick Sort  | Big O Time & Space |
| Stacks & Queues      | Binary Search      |   Recursion    |
| Linked Lists    | Merge Sort       | Bit Manipulation  |
| Heaps      |    Breadth-First Search   |     Dynamic Programming  |
| Trees,  Graphs   | Depth-First Search       | Memory (Stack vs. Heap)      |
And also hash tables.
This is just a categorization and not the syllabus so yes topics are not written here
