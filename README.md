# The Coding Interview (Python)
This is new repository in which we will first make a map and then follow it in order to complete all required topic in Programming interviews.
## Getting Started
We will start by first defining the scope of this repo.<br>
We will cover Data structure, Algorithms and Programming Concepts.
| Data structure      | Algorithms | Programming Concepts     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| Array and lists     |  Quick Sort  | Big O Time & Space |
| Stacks & Queues      | Binary Search      |   Recursion    |
| Linked Lists    | Merge Sort       | Bit Manipulation  |
| Heaps      |    Breadth-First Search   |     Dynamic Programming  |
| Trees,  Graphs   | Depth-First Search       | Memory (Stack vs. Heap)      |


And also hash tables.<br>
This is just a categorization and not the syllabus so yes topics are not written here.

## Walking Through a Problem - The Thinking Process
This is one of the most underrated process that I generally mess-up. So I am just gonna clarify
all the things to keep in mind and also the process that we should use<br>
Note - This is more like a stater bundle I would recommend to improvise it more and more.<br>
#### 1. Reading the problem statement 
Note all important data that can be extracted from that problem, we will need each and every bit of that data.
#### 2. Example or Sample Test Cases
This is the part which helps us thinking, and tells us how the program should run.<br>
We can end up finding some cool pattern hidden in solved examples if we play close attention.
#### 3. Brute Force 
Coming up with more basic and naive solution helps us in breaking the problem and works as our first milestone. This step is more important for beginners (including me) as we can find more insights after solving this problem.
#### 4. Optimization
The is the part for which we all are working. Solving a problem is not a that big challenge optimizing it, is.
